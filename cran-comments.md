This is the second try to submit a new package ggjoy, which provides new geoms for ggplot2.

I received two requests for changes in response to the first try:

> Please single quote ggplot2.
Done.

> Can you provide a reference for joyplot in the form 
> Authors (year) <DOI:.....> (with no space after 'DOI:')?
No, no such reference exists at this time. I only have the code on github.

## Test environments
* R devel and R 3.4.1 on win-builder [ via devtools::build_win() ]
* local OS X install x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit), R 3.3.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There is one NOTE, about spelling:
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Joyplots (3:8, 8:14)

The spelling is correct.

## Downstream dependencies
None, this is a first-time submission.
